# PCOD Risk Calculator (Python)

## 📌 Overview

This project is a simple Python-based PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease) risk score calculator. It collects basic clinical indicators from the user and estimates a risk score using rule-based logic. The project is built as a beginner-friendly healthcare + Python + Git workflow practice project.

## 🎯 Purpose

* Practice Python scripting
* Learn Git & GitHub workflow
* Build healthcare-oriented mini tools
* Create an AI/health portfolio starter project

## 🧪 Inputs Used

The calculator asks for:

* BMI value
* Irregular menstrual cycles (yes/no)
* Acne presence (yes/no)
* Excess hair growth (yes/no)

## ⚙️ How It Works

Each risk factor contributes to a score.
Higher total score → higher PCOD risk category.

Risk categories:

* Low risk
* Moderate risk
* High risk (clinical evaluation recommended)

## ▶️ How to Run

### Step 1 — Install Python

Make sure Python is installed and added to PATH.

### Step 2 — Run Script

```bash
python pcod_risk.py
```

### Step 3 — Enter Inputs

Provide values when prompted in the terminal.

## 🧠 Example Run

```
PCOD Risk Score Calculator
Enter BMI: 29
Irregular cycles? (y/n): y
Acne present? (y/n): n
Excess hair growth? (y/n): y

Risk Score: 8
High PCOD risk — clinical evaluation recommended
```
